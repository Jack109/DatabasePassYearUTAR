Has gained importance recently for various reasons:
  may be desirable to treat Web sources like a database, but cannot constrain these sources with a schema;
  may be desirable to have a flexible format for data exchange between disparate databases;
  emergence of XML as standard for data representation and exchange on the Web, and similarity between XML documents and semistructured data.

First because of the big data. Many data does not have a fix schema,so we make a semi structure data so we can have a flexible schema.
semi structure data allow exchange data between different database easily.
